Both essays respond and address the question correctly. Good job!

It seems like you did not even check the PDF before submitting it, there is a
line `as' in the middle of the DFA drawing. What is up with that?

Why doesn't your .pdf have your name?

The DFA looks ok, except for the above.

You could use $\Sigma$ more to save some space. Lets say that you want to make
an arrow if the next symbol is not an 'f', you could simply say $\{\Sigma - f\}$,
which means the set of all possible symbols of the whole alphabet minus 'f'.
