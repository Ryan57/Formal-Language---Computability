Neat DFA diagram in a .pdf
- ok
State-transition table
- ok
Descriptions of each state
- ok
5 test cases accepted by the DFA
- not as text files
5 test cases rejected by the DFA 
- not as text files

Analysis
- Good quality of DFA diagram
- Good state descriptions
- Good and efficient construction of the DFA

Completeness 
- Test cases are difficult and interesting
- Includes both correct and incorrect statements
- Includes both correct and incorrect asignments
- Includes both correct and incorrect identifiers

Correctness
- DFA diagram is incorrect:
  > some states do not consider the possibility of receiving all possible
    symbols in the alphabet; e.g., you are at an accepting state, and still all
    possible \Sigma symbols can occur: || print ( a ) var p || should be
    accepted
- Tables are correct
- Test cases are incorrect:
  > your alphabet does not support capital letters, not even in comments!
